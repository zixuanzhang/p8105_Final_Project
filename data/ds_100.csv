Want to build a bot that continuously learns by itself how to deal with live site incidents, accumulates the knowledge and use the knowledge to help every OnCall engineer?
Want to do all your DevOps scenarios via Microsoft Teams using chat such as check the latest test run result, trigger a deployment, check service health and mitigate an incident?
Want to help start and build a community project that every Microsoft engineer can contribute to and extend?
Have you imagined mitigating a live site issue completely over the phone using voice with the help from an intelligent assistant in the Cloud?

If any of the above challenges excites you, this is the opportunity for you! Azure IcM and Communications team is looking for an engineering leader and manager to lead our DevOps bot team.

At Microsoft scale, intuitive interaction and collaboration between service teams, DRIs, incident managers and Communications managers are the keys to ensure we can handle live site outages efficiently and effectively. This requires a natural user interface that can let engineers interact with the system anywhere, anytime and integrations with system like Microsoft Teams to build collaboration capabilities directly into the daily tools people use. Based on the SREBot Azure SRE team initially created, we are forming a DevOps bot team in the IcM and Communications team. The vision of the team is to create a self-learning bot with natural language interface for DevOps scenarios such as operating cloud services, monitoring services, manage live site incidents, mitigate live site issues, etc. We plan to build this bot in an extensible and community-driven model so that every team can plug in their custom knowledge and skill to make it their own with minimal effort and maintenance cost. Having a DevOps bot increases collaboration, learning and knowledge sharing within and beyond the engineering team and can integrate various development and operation tools in one central place with high level of automation and natural interaction. We also envision the bot to be self-learning and become the knowledge base for the teams by learning from the interactions and history.
Responsibilities

IcM is a mission critical service, the cornerstone of our efforts to enable every Microsoft service team to run an efficient and automated live site, without the need of a dedicated operations staff through automation and advanced tooling. The Incident Management Service enables the automated management of incident lifecycle and is directly responsible for impacting key metrics like Time to Engage (TTE) and Time to Resolve (TTR) for live site incidents. Having all Microsoft service incidents together enables us to run data analytics and machine learning on it and help us detect incident patterns to reduce Time to Mitigation (TTM) and even avoid future incidents. We are heavily invested in the machine learning and intelligence capability to enable Azure and Microsoft service teams to manage their service health efficiently. As the leader driving the interaction and collaboration aspects of our incident management system and other DevOps tools, you are going to play a critical role in our mission to scale Microsoft services with the highest reliability and lowest live site operation overhead.

Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines, to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.
Program synthesis is a new frontier in AI where-in the computer programs itself-a synthesizer interprets user intent and produces a script or a program for the task. The user intent may be given as input-output examples, constraints on the program, or other high-level specifications. This is significant because 99% people who own computers do not know programming. Even for programmers, this can provide a 10-100x productivity increase for many task domains, and especially in the areas of data wrangling/preparation and code refactoring.
The PROSE SDK is a powerful and flexible framework that uses state-of-the-art program synthesis and machine learning techniques to automate repetitive tasks in a variety of domains. The strength and breadth of the framework is evidenced by the range of Microsoft products that use it, including Excel, Powershell, SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Machine Learning Workbench.
Our experience in using program synthesis in practice has helped us identify several unique and interesting research challenges. How does one test and debug programs when a synthesizer is involved? What user experience and programming interfaces are appropriate when the primary mode of interaction is through input-output examples? How can we adapt the generated programs each user's programming style and coding convention? How can we adapt and improve ML techniques to a setting where logical constraints are present? These challenges require both novel research ideas and practical-minded engineering to address satisfactorily.

Our team is looking for research interns to work on several projects related to the above challenges and several other aspects of the PROSE ecosystem. Below are some specific research directions we are exploring:
a) Task-guided string clustering. In the setting of data preparation and data wrangling, strings are clustered with the aim of processing the clusters separately for standardization or analysis. Can we leverage knowledge about this further processing steps to produce better clusters than traditional methods?
b) User experiences around program synthesis. The nature of program synthesis is that it expects some level of user involvement and expertise: either in specifying behavior, verifying that the synthesized program meets their needs, or providing a means through which the user can provide additional specifications. How can we surface program synthesis through novel user interfaces to help users effectively complete tasks?
c) Generate human-readable and modifiable code. Many current program synthesis approaches are black boxes: they assume that the user is only interested in completing the task, without needing to know the internals of the synthesized programs. However, in domains such as data science, users of the system demand not only want to verify the generated code, they also want to be able to incorporate or extend this code into their programs. How can we synthesize programs that are also human-readable?

You will establish the roadmap for our customer facing functionalities, ensure prioritization and ultimately build these features. Shipping a high quality toolset always requires being data driven and having strong engineering skills. You need to be obsessed with ensuring the best end to end experience for our customers.

As a TPM, you will anticipate bottlenecks, provide escalation management, anticipate and make trade-offs, and balance the business needs versus technical constraints. An ability to take large, complex projects and break them down into manageable pieces, develop functional specifications, then deliver them in a successful and timely manner is expected.

"1472","Senior Manager for Automated Profitability Management","amazon.com","Job Description
The vision of Automated Profitability Management (APM) is to automate and improve Amazon Retail Profitability through the innovative application of Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

Traditionally, this involved an Amazon retail business person picking up the phone, calling up their counter-part on the supplier side to discuss and improve the terms of doing business with Amazon. These terms include: what is the price Amazon should pay to the vendor for a given unit of a product? Can we get vendor to provide funding for initiatives on Amazon (e.g. volume-based incentives, promotions / merchandising opportunities on our website)? How do we handle the cost of bringing in the product / cover any damage to the products? Do we have alternative sourcing channels (e.g. two or more vendors offering the same product) so we can negotiate harder? Each of these negotiation decisions has a direct impact on Amazon＊s profitability.

Now imagine doing this across tens of thousands of suppliers and tens of millions of products, across tens of different countries worldwide, and at a double-digit growth rate every year. Clearly it is not a problem we can solve with humans because we won＊t be able to scale. Instead of relying on humans to make the final call, we will have machines make the actual decisions, so it is completely ＆hands off the wheels＊ from humans.

How do we do that? The good thing is we have data. Tons of them 每 historical contracts, product costs and historical supplier funding, sales performance etc. We will leverage this advantage to solve the problem using algorithms, machine learning and data-driven approaches. Hence we are turning the art of Retail profitability management into a science. At Automated Profitability Systems, we are developing systems that will use technology to disrupt and fundamentally change the way e-commerce costs and supplier terms are managed.

We are looking for a person who can think big and be a change driver. You are strong at communicating your plans to the Retail leadership and influencing them. As a leader of this organization, you will manage several disciplines including Software Development, User Experience, Program Management, Research and Data Scientists.

You have passion for excellence. The wrong choice of analysis could cost the business dearly. You maintain rigorous statistical standards and take ownership of the outcome your analyses suggest.

You have a limitless curiosity. You constantly ask questions and break apart problems scientifically. You form hypotheses and then eagerly try to break them.

You value relationships and patient explanation. Part of being a trusted advisor is building a strong track record and continually demonstrating to your customers that your analysis will save them money and time. You break down your model assumptions without jargon and help customers understand where your model fails.
